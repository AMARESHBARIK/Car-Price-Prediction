Random Forest Regression algorithm to predict the price of cars

Given a dataset car data.csv containing details on used cars with specific details as Car_Name, Year, Selling_Price,	Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, Owner. Using RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION I have found the best features and applied the ML algorithm to predict the price of cars in the future.
